#  Modeling Initial Claims as Quasi-Natural Disasters 

Unprecedented is a word often used in the context of the economic
data being generated in the post-COVID world, but are there historical
episodes that may be useful in serving as guide in terms of thinking
about near-term job losses after the initial shock observed in late March.
What could the path of initial claims be over the next few months, and what
should we expect in terms of the total number of claims during thi period?

In [Bram & Deitz](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2020/04/the-coronavirus-shock-looks-more-like-a-natural-disaster-than-a-cyclical-downturn.html) an interesting idea to answer this question is explored
--- that the COVID shock to labor markets is more akin to a natural disaster like
hurricane Katrina or Maria, rather than a classic recession-induced
hit to employment. As they correctly point out

> Recessions typically develop gradually over time, reflecting underlying
  economic and financial conditions, whereas the current economic situation
  developed suddenly as a consequence of a fast-moving global pandemic.
  A more appropriate comparison would be to a regional economy suffering
  the effects of a severe natural disaster, like Louisiana after Hurricane
  Katrina or Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. To illustrate this point, we
  track the recent path of unemployment claims in the United States, finding a
  much closer match with Louisiana after Katrina than the U.S. economy
  following the Great Recession.

While the national scope of the COVID shock is clearly different and unprecedented,
there are similarities with natural disasters which by their nature, tend to
be more localized. As such, they can provide insights into the way labor markets
evolve in the short-run. We do this by estimating exponential decay models for
different episodes, both natural-disaster related or recession-driven, and
calibrate the parameters of this process to the historical data on claims.
